## Overview
This project implements a basic text generation model using Markov chains. It processes a sample text to build a word-level Markov chain (a dictionary of word transitions) and generates new text sequences that imitate the original style. The implementation is done in Python within a Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to experiment with different inputs and parameters.

Markov chains are a simple yet effective way to model sequences probabilistically, commonly used in text generation, predictive typing, and more. This project serves as an educational example for understanding stochastic processes in natural language processing.

## Problem Statement
Create a simple probabilistic model using Markov chains to generate new text sequences that mimic the style and structure of a given sample text. The model should build a transition dictionary from the input text (word-level) and use it to produce coherent, randomized sentences starting from a specified word, demonstrating basic natural language generation techniques without relying on advanced machine learning frameworks.

## Features
- **Word-Level Markov Chain**: Builds a transition model from sample text.
- **Text Generation**: Produces randomized text of a specified length starting from a given word.
- **Simple and Extensible**: Easy to modify for character-level chains or larger corpora.
- **No External Dependencies**: Uses only standard Python libraries (`random` and `collections`).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab) for running the `.ipynb` file
- No additional packages needed (relies on built-in modules)
